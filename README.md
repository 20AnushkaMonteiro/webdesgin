## the wealthiest short story 
prize I have judged was the Sunday Times EFG short story award, which presents the victor with £30,000. If the winning writer were to use every single one of the 6,000 words allowed them, that would work out at a fiver a word, which puts them on a par with that other well-paid writer of creative fiction, the columnist Boris Johnson.

### In straitened times 
for writers, you would think a prize bonanza like this is a good thing – but it cuts no ice with Philip Hensher, editor of The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story, published two years after his immense anthology-cum-survey of the British short story since c1700 and designed, in part, to compensate for some of the space-related omissions of the last project.

**Prizes,** *writes Hensher* in his introduction, are detrimental to the current practice and status of the short story in this country. He begins with a fairly inarguable point, that literary competitions of all kinds are “mostly harmless if they form part of a healthy ecology”; and it is that surrounding ecology – the decline in numbers of short stories appearing in newspapers and magazines, the fact that publishers have yet to properly exploit the possibilities of releasing single short stories in digital form – that is struggling.
